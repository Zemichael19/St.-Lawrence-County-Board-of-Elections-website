    <span>Voting Early</span>
    <p>Early voting will occur at our Canton Board of Elections office in the two weeks before each upcoming special, primary or general election.</p>
    <span>Registering in Person</span>
    <p>Registration forms are available at most government offices and post offices, or you may register in person Monday through Friday at the St. Lawrence County Board of Elections Office. </p>
    <span>Choosing the Correct Form</span>
    <p>When registering to vote via the DMV make sure you receive the correct form. One form allows you to register for the first time, the other form is used if you've moved within St. Lawrence County and wish to notify the Board of Elections of your new address to maintain active voting status. Also note it can take up to a month for registrations from the DMV and other social service agencies to reach the board. Therefore your registration will be postmarked timely as of the date received by the St. Lawrence County Board of Elections.</p>
    <span>Requesting a Voter Registration Form Over the Phone</span>
    <p>Call 315 379-2202 and a registration form will be sent to you in the mail to complete and return. Register By Mail or e-Mail a Request for Application</p>
