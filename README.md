Overall comments on grading questions:

1) Does your site make the information easy to find?
    - Better than the original, but some information is missing.
    - I have to dig and do some math to find the early voting dates in 2020.
    - Early voting information seems out of place on the "How to Register" page.
    - I can't find the registration and absentee deadlines in 2020.

2) Are the pages reasonably structured with HTML?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - The home page isn't called index.html, which is the traditional name.
    - The home page is pretty, but information-free.
    - Headings on most pages are just generic spans rather than proper headings.
    - List item tags (li) should only appear inside of list tags (ul, ol).
    - The footer uses ul tags for things that are not lists.

3) Are the pages tolerably styled with Bootstrap?
    -  You mentioned that you used more custom CSS than Bootstrap, but I'm actually seeing no Bootstrap at all.
    - The fixed-width header image causes alignment issues at most screen widths.
    - Bulleted lists don't look right centered. Longer text also gets harder to read that way.
    - Content on some of the pages could use more of a left and/or right margin.
    - The address information is seems out of place on most pages because of how it's aligned.
    - The footer would look more like a footer spread out along the bottom, with a brown background like the header.
